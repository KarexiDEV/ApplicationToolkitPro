# ApplicationToolkitPro
Application Toolkit Pro is a comprehensive software manager for Windows users who want full control over their installed programs. It goes beyond the standard 'Add or Remove Programs' tool by listing everything in one place: traditional Win32 software, Microsoft Store (UWP) apps, and even portable applications found with the built-in scanner.
